# Carbon_Emissions_AICTE

**This is the project about CO2 Emission Prediction**
**AI/ML Internship Project – June 2025 Batch**

This project is part of the AI/ML Internship program for the June 2025 cohort. The goal is to explore, clean, and prepare a climate dataset focusing on **CO₂ emissions and other greenhouse gases** for future machine learning tasks.

## ✅ Week 1 Milestone – Data Cleaning & Preparation  
📅 **Completed: 18 June 2025**

- Loaded Excel sheets directly using `pandas.read_excel()`
- Removed null values, irrelevant rows, and unnecessary columns
- Reformatted and structured the dataset for ML readiness
- Exported cleaned dataset to `data_cleaned.csv`

**🛠 Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Week 2 Milestone – Data Exploration & Visualization  
📅 **Completed: 24 June 2025**

- Imported the cleaned dataset (`data_cleaned.csv`)
- Analyzed feature columns and decoded abbreviations
- Selected relevant features for ML and dropped redundant ones
- Created visualizations:
  - 📊 Correlation heatmap
  - 🧮 Scatterplots for feature distribution
  - 📈 Histograms for pattern recognition
  - 🚨 Outlier detection using plots
- Identified meaningful trends and dependencies in the data

**🛠 Tools Used:**  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔜 Week 3 Preview – Model Building (Coming Soon)
- Feature selection & train-test split
- Build baseline regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using R², MAE, MSE
- Feature importance analysis

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Understand and clean real-world environmental datasets
- Explore relationships between CO₂ emissions and socio-economic indicators
- Prepare data for predictive modeling
- Build interpretable and effective ML models for environmental forecasting

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
